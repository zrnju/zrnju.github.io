        <h4 id="Project Background"><a href="#Project Background" class="headerlink"
            title="Project Background"></a>Cloud-based integrated smart contract development environment IDE supporting
          multi-chains</h4>

        <p><br>The key of this project is to leverage the capabilities of cloud computing to enhance development
          efficiency. Through ChainIDE, developers can eliminate extensive local configuration work by integrating
          multiple blockchain node clients, runtime environments, SDKs, and smart contract editors into one platform.
          This innovative approach not only significantly saves developers' time but also using cloud storage greatly
          reduces the marginal cost of development, ignoring platform and terminal restrictions. Specific technological
          innovations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Frontend support for multi-chain through plugin system, reducing the complexity of multi-chain
            development and enhancing system scalability.</li>
          <li> 2. Scalable virtual machine sandbox environment, utilizing cloud computing power to achieve a
            desktop-level development experience in just one browser.</li>
          <li> 3. Smart contract DevOps based on microservices, adopting a continuous deployment strategy to make smart
            contract development and deployment more efficient.</li>
          <li> 4. Visualization of multi-chain operations, emphasizing the tracking of consensus transactions and
            providing a visual solution for better managing and monitoring multi-chain environments.</li>
        </ul>

        </h4>
        <p><br><br>The project currently supports 12 blockchains, including ETH, BSC, Conflux, Dfinity, Nervos, Polygon,
          Flow, Aptos, Chain33, Fisco Bcos, Ant, XDC, and has partnered with Astar, Sui, and Iris for future support of
          more popular blockchains. It is the most widely known smart contract development IDE that supports the largest
          number of chains in the market and has been featured and recommended on official websites by over 7 blockchain
          authorities, including ETH and BSC. It has been widely served in over 160 countries, with over 8 million smart
          contract compilations, making it the primary choice for global blockchain developers.</p>
          <p>
          Furthermore, the project has obtained more than 30 software copyrights, applied for more than 10 invention
          patents, and published over 6 high-level domestic and international journal/conference papers. It has received
          prestigious awards, including the first prize in the 4th China Blockchain Development Contest, recognition as
          one of the Top 50 Innovators in Global Blockchain Enterprises, and selection as a featured blockchain
          technology application case in 2021. It has been incorporated into the curriculum of several top 100
          universities, including the University of British Columbia, the University of Alberta, and the Chinese
          University of Hong Kong. Moreover, it has been used by various users, including Ant Blockchain, Tencent Fisco
          Bcos, and Hyperchain, and received strategic investment from Ant.</p>

        <p><br><br>In recent years, on an international scale, the global blockchain-related industry has been rapidly flourishing. Blockchain technology has found widespread applications in various sectors, including government security, finance, intellectual property, daily life, and social interactions. The development of blockchain relies on a robust foundation of smart contracts, and the efficiency of smart contract development significantly influences the pace of growth in the global blockchain industry. Currently, the market is flooded with various application layers dedicated to smart contract development.

          However, this project, serving as a cross-platform, cross-device, cloud-based integrated smart contract development environment IDE supporting over 10 blockchains, addresses the shortcomings seen in similar products, such as high learning curves, complexity in cross-chain development, and the inability to cover the entire smart contract development lifecycle. It greatly enhances developers' efficiency in development and delivery. This holds significant importance for the development of the blockchain industry in China and globally.</p>
